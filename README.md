# PRODIGY_DS_02
Task 2 of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset with visualizations and insights.

This repository contains my submission for **Task 2** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**.  
The task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights and visualize patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in this Repository
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis  
- `Titanic_EDA.html` â†’ Exported HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing  
- `train.csv` â†’ Training dataset used for analysis  
- `test.csv` â†’ Test dataset provided  
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation

## ðŸ“Š Key Steps in the Analysis
- Data inspection (`df` and `df.info()`)  
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked)  
- Feature engineering (Family size, etc.)  
- Data visualization (count plots, heatmaps, histograms, KDE plots)  
- Correlation analysis using `df.corr()`

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Gender:** Women had higher survival rates than men.  
- **Class:** Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better chances of survival.  
- **Family size:** Having a small family size increased survival probability.  
- **Embarked Port:** Passengers from certain embarkation points had different survival trends.
